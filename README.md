# boilerplate-vanilla-spa
My boilerplate for a vanilla js spa, the main goal of this is to build an SPA with just basic javascript
no dependecies needed, yet, just run with:

`npm run dev`

using es6-string-html extension will make it easier to code the html code in the return string
just prefix the return with
`/*html*/`


this doesn't have a compiler cause the way it is intented to be, i can't install any dependency,
so, have to do it manualy

and this is not yet the final version, i keep working on this
