# boilerplate-vanilla-spa :flying_saucer:
My boilerplate for a vanilla js spa, the main goal of this is to build an SPA with just basic javascript
no dependecies needed, yet, just run with:

```
  npm start
```

and your are good to go.

I had to write my own little server to serve all the file requested, it may have some bug but getting there slowly

This doesn't have a compiler cause the way it is intented to be, i can't install any dependency,
so, maybe have to do it manualy

I keep working on this

please put a little **star** on it if you feel like doing it :wink:
