# General structure :dart:

`app.js` is the entry point of the application
it only contain the app initialisation with a css import and routes.

## Views 

A view contain atleast one file, i.e `{name}_view.js` a file containing the elements creation.
A view can import a script file `{name}_script.js`, wich contain the view's logic.

I tried to make all things self explainatory but i'll keep adding more things in those readme file.
